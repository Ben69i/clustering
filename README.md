the whole idea of this kind of clustering with so much lightweight computations is now depricated 
this project only was so testing purposes
accuracy is much higher than sklearn kmeans
it uses kmeans++ and optimized center finding functions for better perf
avg runtime was a little lower that sklearn kmeans!
