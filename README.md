the whole idea of this kind of clustering with so much lightweight computations is now depricated;
this project only was for testing purposes, and its not rec to use it for real-deal data!;
accuracy is much higher than sklearn kmeans
it uses kmeans++ and optimized center finding functions for better perf;
avg runtime was a little lower that sklearn kmeans!
